              The Sinners Club comes from an idea of a group of entrepreneurs
              and investors that loathe getting comfortable with repetitive
              activities and are in search of a thrilling life and profitable
              activities. This club is not just for people who know how to live
              their life but the ambitious ones who know how to invest their
              free time

              The Sinners Club is for the people that hate having an ordinary
              life and enjoy top-notch things of life, in other words: for the
              bold. Being part of this exclusive club gives you access to the
              best features, such as real estate off-market deals, private
              investments and one of the first nightlife locations in the
              Metaverse which will include profit-sharing benefits.The community
              is the core of our project, so we want to build a solid community
              that believes and trusts our mission in the long-term. If you're
              here for the short-term, this is probably not the most suitable
              project for you

              Rewards and Passive Income:
            </h3>
            <p className="text-sm italic leading-snug tracking-wide text-white text-opacity-100">
              Within our 5000 NFT Collection there will be 777 special and rare
              NFTs called THE DEADLY SINNERS. These exclusive NFTs will have
              special benefits, but the greatest benefit will be that the 50% of
              the profits of our club (gambling games, horse races, inside-club
              consumables profits and more) will be split between the holders of
              the 777 Deadly Sinners as PASSIVE INCOME. If you didnâ€™t get one of
              the Deadly Sinners, the rest of the collection will benefit from
              the 20% of the profits. <br /> <br />
              Example: If our club makes $500,000 in profit each month: <br />
              <span className="pl-2">
                - $250,000 will go to the 777 deadly sinners, or $321 per NFT{" "}

              <br />
              <span className="pl-2">
                - $100,000 will go to the standard sinners, or $23 per NFT{" "}

              The nightlife is the main core of this project, simply because
              this will be the place in which Sinners all over the world will
              meet to chat, drink, and play betting games, but mainly to build a
              community.
              <br /> <br />
              Our club will consist of different areas in which there will be
              different activities, including: <br />
              - Gambling hall (poker,blackjack,roulette, etc.)
              <br />
              - Horse Racing Track

              Our plan is buying a 3x3 parcel in the Sandbox or Decentraland
              metaverse. The community will decide which one to buy. We will
              show our business projections.
